Its good practice to put each workshop in its own folder. Name it what erver you would like, just make sure that you remember it. 

First create a file called `hello_world_tsc.ts`. 
Then write a program that prints the text "HELLO, WORLD" to the console (stdout).

## HINTS

To pass this exercise, you must do two things. First create a function "greeter" with a declared type. An example is: 

```ts
function Greeter(greeting: string){
    this.greeting = greeting;
}
```
We will cover types in the next exercise.
